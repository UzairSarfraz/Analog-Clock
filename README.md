# Analog-Clock
This is an Analog Clock made by using HTML/CSS &amp; JavaScript. It uses the Date function to fetch the time and display the exact time according to your location on the screen.
A list is created in HTML for numbering 1-12 and fonts are used from google fonts. The background gradient color is taken from CSSgradient.com and the list of 1-12 is rotated in the way that it makes a round than the text it converte to transform itself that it looks written straight. Needles are created and left empty in HTML, by the use of CSS the needles are designed and by using Javascript the needles move in the degrees that are assigned to them.
The output was very attractive due to the colors and the background that I used.
